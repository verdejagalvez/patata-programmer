              The Monalisa potato is one of the potato varieties with the lowest water content, which makes it very versatile in the kitchen.
              It is medium in size, oval in shape, soft to the touch and light in color, making it one of the best-known types of potatoes.<br><br>
              It is classified as an early potato and its high percentage of starch makes it very useful for frying, since it accumulates little oil.
              Boiled, it reaches its cooking point sooner than other varieties and, in addition, maintains its shape better, helping the presentation of the dish.

              <dd>On the other hand we have grenaille potatoes, they are small tubers that remain in the ground after harvesting the potatoes with standard measurements or caliber,
              They are marketed (at least in the neighboring country) under the name of Grenailles potatoes, although in our market, especially if we usually buy in fruit and vegetable stores where a good part of their products are homegrown,
              They will simply be found in separate boxes and labeled potatoes..</dd>
